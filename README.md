# Acoustic Emanations Tool
Experimental application for the analysis of keyboard acoustic emanations.

## About
Mechanical keypads are vulnerable to attacks based on differentiating the sound emanated by different keys.
This application uses a neural network to calculate a confusion matrix based on training data of key presses previously recorded.
The tool includes a recording function to capture the training data.

Development was based on [Udacity 2018 Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone project](https://github.com/mikesmales/Udacity-ML-Capstone)
