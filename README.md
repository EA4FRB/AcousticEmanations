# Acoustic Emanations Tool
Acoustic emanations tool

## About
Experimental application for the analysis of keyboard acoustic emanations. 
Mechanical keypads are vulnerable to attacks based on differentiating the sound emanated by different keys. 
This application uses a neural network to calculate a confusion matrix based on training data previously captured.
The tool has the capability to capture the training data.

Development was based on [Udacity 2018 Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone project](https://github.com/mikesmales/Udacity-ML-Capstone)
